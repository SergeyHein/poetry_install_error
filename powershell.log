Retrieving Poetry metadata

# Welcome to Poetry!

This will download and install the latest version of Poetry,
a dependency and package manager for Python.

It will add the `poetry` command to Poetry's bin directory, located at:

<user profile>\AppData\Roaming\Python\Scripts

You can uninstall at any time by executing this script with the --uninstall option,
and these changes will be reverted.

Installing Poetry (1.6.1): Done

Poetry (1.6.1) is installed now. Great!

To get started you need Poetry's bin directory (<user profile>\AppData\Roaming\Python\Scripts) in your `PATH`
environment variable.

Alternatively, you can call Poetry explicitly with `<user profile>\AppData\Roaming\Python\Scripts\poetry`.

You can test that everything is set up by executing:

`poetry --version`
